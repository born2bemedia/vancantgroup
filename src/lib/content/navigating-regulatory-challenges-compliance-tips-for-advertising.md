*   **Disclose Risks and Disclaimers**: Disclose any risks associated with using your product or service and include disclaimers where necessary. Be transparent about the potential risks to ensure that your advertising complies with consumer protection laws.
*   **Avoid Deceptive Practices**: Avoid using misleading or deceptive advertising practices that could mislead consumers or create false expectations. Provide accurate and truthful information about your products or services, and avoid making exaggerated claims or promises.
*   **Use Clear and Non-Misleading Language**: Use clear and non-misleading language in your advertising copy to ensure that consumers understand the risks and benefits of engaging with your project. Avoid technical jargon or complex terminology that could confuse or mislead your audience.
